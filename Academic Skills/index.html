            <h1>Time management</h1>
            <p>
                Time management is the ability to organize and schedule your time efficiently. In school, 
                you might've used these skills to study more effectively or devote
                 sufficient time to working on several assignments. While working, you may often have deadlines, 
                and understanding how to manage your schedule can help increase your productivity.
