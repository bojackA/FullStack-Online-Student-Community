                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Organisation</h2>
                    <p>Staying organised helps you to keep track of your responsibilities and priorities, 
                        like what you need to do first and when to do the rest of it. 
                        An organised list of tasks acts as a map to guide you
                         from morning to evening and helps increase your productivity. 
                         A well-organised plan helps you break down large goals into smaller, 
                        easily achievable tasks and enables you to complete those tasks on time.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Prioritisation</h2>
                    <p>Prioritisation is the key to successful time management.
                         When you prioritise your daily tasks,
                          you ensure that you will complete the important tasks first.
                           Write down every single task starting with the top priority. 
                        For instance, you can break down your tasks as the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A-level tasks: Things that will lead to major consequences if not done today</li>
                            <li>B-level tasks: Activities that may have a negative effect if not completed today</li>
                            <li>C-level tasks: Activities that have no consequence if not completed today</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Goal setting</h2>
                    <p>Goal setting is the process of defining your aims and objectives with 
                        a certain plan to help you achieve the set goals. Setting goals is a key step in excelling as
                         a professional. Without goals, you may find it challenging to complete your tasks 
                         in a well-organised manner. Setting both short- and long-term goals can lead to 
                         success in your career. An example of a short-term goal may be to increase sales in your department by 40%.
                         A long-term goal could be something like completing law school or starting your own business.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Communication</h2>
                    <p>Communication skills are a major component of success in life. 
                        Effective communication promotes trust and makes your plans and goals clear to people you work with.
                         It plays a crucial role in resolving conflicts and preventing potential conflict situations. 
                        Strong communication helps you delegate more work,
                         which lets you focus more on the important tasks that support your goals.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Planning</h2>
                    <p>Planning is the core of time management. With a proper plan, you can prioritise your tasks accordingly, which can help avoid confusion and unnecessary stress. A planned work schedule helps you complete the tasks in the given time frame. For example, a plan for a project manager might include ordering supplies, scheduling labour, acquiring the proper permits and so on.</p>
                    <h2>Delegation</h2>
                    <p>It is an important process to manage multiple tasks satisfactorily. While managing a project, you can delegate some of the tasks to your subordinates. This will help in reducing your workload so that you can focus more on important tasks, such as planning, business analysis and others.</p>
                
                    <h2>Why Are Time Management Skills Important?</h2>

                    <p>If you want to excel in life, you have to respect the importance of time and find a way to manage it efficiently. Time management skills help you systematically organise your tasks and accomplish them by their deadline.

                        For example, if you are looking for a job, you need to devote time to updating your resume, searching for job openings, researching good companies for openings, applying and preparing for interviews. Setting aside some specific time daily for the job-related tasks can help you in getting the right job. For example, managing your time properly can give you more time to read job postings thoroughly and finding the ones that best suit your needs.

                        Proper time management allows you to be creative and proactive with your goals. With a well-defined time frame for each workplace task, you can ensure you are contributing to the company in a reliable way.
