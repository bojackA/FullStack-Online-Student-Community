            <p>
               <p> At some point in your career, you'll likely need to speak in front of a group of people. Whether you’re presenting a new project to your team members or pitching an idea to a client, it is important to have strong presentation skills. These soft skills can help you clearly and effectively convey your thoughts and ideas to an audience.

               </p>
                <h2>What are presentation skills?</h2>
                <p>Presentation skills allow you to convey information to an audience. Those with strong presentation skills often:

                </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Research background information for their topic</li>

                <li>Prepare engaging visuals such as slides, videos and graphics</li>
                <li>Connect with their audience through effective storytelling</li>
                <li>Interact with audience members throughout their presentation</li>
                <li>Deliver their presentation in a natural, authentic way</li>
                <li>Memorize key talking points without the need for a line-by-line script</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>Improving your presentation skills</h2>
             <p>Use these tips to improve your presentation skills:</p>
             <h4>1. Present useful information</h4>
             <p>When creating your presentation, determine what information is most useful for your audience. For instance, if you are presenting an idea to your client, think about what aspects of the project will matter to them.
                <br><br>
                You want to recognize and understand who your audience is before even beginning your planning process. Do some background research to learn who might see your presentation and what questions or concerns they might have.

             </p>
             <h4>2. See how the experts do it</h4>
             <p>While practice can certainly help you be a more effective speaker, you can also learn from other speakers. Take time to either attend a presentation in person or watch videos online. Take note of what these speakers do well and what you think they could improve. Try to incorporate some of their effective speaking strategies into your own presentation.

             </p>
             <h4>3. Learn it without notes</h4>
             <p>While you can choose to have cue cards available, try to memorize your presentation. Rather than remembering every single line or a script, however, try to give your presentation using a loose outline.
                <br><br>
                This strategy can help you develop a more natural flow of speaking. Sometimes, memorizing your script verbatim can make it challenging to get back on topic if you forget a line. That's why having a general idea of what you're going to say may be more forgiving.

             </p>
             <h4>4. Watch yourself in the mirror</h4>
             <p>When practicing your presentation, watch yourself in the mirror to observe your gestures and other nonverbal cues. You could even record yourself and watch the footage afterward. During your presentation, make an effort to look engaged in what you’re saying.

             </p>
             <h4>5. Use your presentation as an opportunity</h4>
             <p>Rather than feeling apprehensive about your presentation, reframe it as an exciting opportunity. Try to figure out ways to feel excited about meeting with your colleagues or clients.
                <br><br>
                For instance, when presenting a project to a client, think of it as a chance to impress them. Likewise, when meeting with coworkers, think of your presentation as a way to pass on important information.

             </p>
             <h4>6. Give yourself time to prepare</h4>
             <p>Try to arrive at your meeting room 15 minutes early. This gives you time to set up your devices and displays and get familiar with the setting. Having time to prepare for your presentation can help you feel calmer and more confident.

             </p>
            <h4>7. Use a visual aid</h4>
            <p>Along with triggering your memory, a visual aid can make your presentation more interesting. Consider speaking alongside a slideshow. When preparing your slideshow, use as little text as possible.
                <br><br>
                Most of the information you share should come from you. Use slides to share statistics, data, graphs and images. You might also want to add a supplementary video to break up your presentation and keep your audience engaged.

            </p>
            <h4>8. Practice positive thinking</h4>
            <p>Remember that you are your biggest critic and that your coworkers want to see you succeed. Before your presentation, give yourself a little pep talk. Remind yourself that you put in the time and effort to make a quality presentation and that you are going to do great.

            </p>
            <h4>9. Stay on topic</h4>
            <p>Keep your audience's attention by staying on topic throughout your presentation. Try to make your presentation as narrow as you can, covering information that is relevant to your audience. You can always do a follow-up presentation if you feel like there are other important topics to talk about.

            </p>
            <h4>10. Follow a general outline</h4>
            <p>Your presentation needs a beginning, middle and end. Use the first few minutes to introduce your audience to what you plan to discuss. Then, you can get into the bigger details and supplementary information. Finally, end your presentation with a summary and time for questions.

            </p>
            <h4>11. Connect with your audience</h4>
            <p>Before you begin your presentation, feel free to chat with your audience as people are getting settled. This can help you feel more comfortable and create a connection with your audience.</p>
            <h4>12. Relax your mind and body</h4>
            <p>Find a quiet, private room to do some mental and physical preparation. You can mentally prepare by telling yourself positive affirmations. "I can do this," “I am a good speaker" and "I have interesting things to say" are all helpful reminders. You can physically prepare with some deep breathing, stretches and power stances.

            </p>
            <h4>13. Be aware of your nonverbal cues</h4>

            <h4>14. Embrace pauses</h4>
            <h4>15. Present to a small group</h4>
            <h4>16. Be open to questions</h4>
            <h4>17. Know your time limit</h4>
            <h4>18. Learn to slow down</h4>
            <h4>19. Stay hydrated</h4>
            <h4>20. Be a storyteller</h4>
